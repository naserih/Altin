Sept 29th: 
- implent lstm with set target size
    > implemented LSTM with 100 training sequence len and 10 forecast length 
- train rolling prediction (might not be helpful)
    > rolling prediction added to the LSTM modeling
    > the output is constant which might be sue to less number of training
    or epoch size. 
    > I might also need to normalize the inpouts

Sept 30th:
- Learn about LSTM and Moving modeling and how they are normally implemented
- find a book on timeseries and start reading
- find technical machine learning and check

Oct 1st:
- read "Time Series Forecasting in Python":
    > might worth trying random walk
    > might worth looking into FFT and seasionality
    > LSTM is a good model to try
    > ARIMA and SARIMA could do good
    > using CNN for feature extraction
    > CNN + LSTM might be helpful


Oct 2nd:
- apply LSTM or RNN with fix train and test batch size.


Oct 3rd:
- Read "Machine Learning for Time-Series with Python"
    > ARCH and GARCH are types of ARIMA for risk management
    > fill missing points with previous
    > autocorrolation for getting ranges
    > try XGBooset
    > need to learn about Probabilistic models
    > learn Markov Switching Model
    > what is HIVE-COTE
    > what is N-BEATS
    what is transformers
    > what is INFORMER

Oct 4th:
- build a LSTM seq2seq model
- add forecast method

Oct 5th:
- Train proper model with 1500/100 on 100 batch of 100 epoch
- Add scaler function
- store model and transformer

Oct 6th:
- Test the performance of the good model
    > still not good
- Investigate more feature
    > got book for technical analysis
- train/predict on features
    > investigating features

Oct 7th:
- read book "Japapanese candlestick teq"
    > ch 3: candel types: hammer, hanging man
    > hammer 3x lower shadow
    hammer followed the decline

Oct 8th:
- Eat Turkey!
- Relax and do nothig
- Read book: "Japapanese candlestick teq", 
    > ch 4: notes in ipad

Oct 9th:
- Relax even more
- Read Books  "Japapanese candlestick teq", 
    > ch4: note in ipad

Oct 10:
- Read book:  "Japapanese candlestick teq", 
- Apply ch 4 into the python.
    > hammer / hanging man
    > spin top
    > engulfment
    > 

Oct 11:
- Vacation planning
-  Read Book "Japapanese candlestick teq", 
 > ch 5


Oct 11 - Oct 22:
- Vacation off

Oct 23 - Oct 31:
- Finished Book on Charting and Technical

Nov 1 - Nov 10:
- Implement candle patterns

Nov 6:
- plotting in loop
- add legends
- find window, doji star, harami, high waves, pearcing,
- find picks
- identify hanging man/hammer,  shooting star/inverse hammer, evening/morning star

Nov 7:
- mountain top, river bott, budha

Nov 8:
- resistance and support lines, previous mins, extra polated lines, 

Nov 9: 
- 5 min, 15 min, ... candles

Nov 10:
- Calculate gain profit based on min max. 

Overall Objectives:
- train a simple model to predict on 20 min data [Done! Failed]
- identify and train on technical features
- train transformes
- learn technical analysis
